[Google translate](http://translate.google.com/) instantly
translates between any pair of over eighty human languages 
like French and English. How does it do that? Why does it 
make the errors that it does? And how can you build something 
better? Modern translation systems like Google Translate and 
[Bing Translator](http://www.microsofttranslator.com/)
*learn* to translate by reading millions of words of already 
translated text. This course will show you how they work. 
We cover fundamental building blocks from linguistics, 
machine learning (especially deep learning), algorithms, and data structures, 
showing how they apply to a difficult
real-word artificial intelligence problem.

Textbooks
: The class follows closely two textbooks.
* [Statistical Machine Translation](http://www.statmt.org/book/) (<a href="http://statmt.org/book/errata.html">errata</a>) 
by [Philipp Koehn](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/), 2010.
You can read it online through the <a href="https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/catalog/bib_3522360">JHU library</a> or 
purchase from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Machine-Translation-Philipp-Koehn/dp/0521874157">Amazon</a>.
* Neural Machine Translation, by [Philipp Koehn](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/), 2019. A draft copy of the book will be distributed by email. Contact the professor to receive a copy.

Grading
: To understand how machine translation works, you will build a translation system.
We will mainly grade hands-on work.

* Five homework assignments (12% each)
* Final project (30%)
* In-class presentation: Language in ten minutes (10%)

Homework Schedule
: There will be five homework assignments, tentative schedule:
* [HW1: Analysis](hw0.html), due September 13
* [HW2: Word alignment](hw1.html), due September 27
* [HW3: Decoding](hw2.html), due October 11
* HW4: Neural translation model part 1, due October 25
* HW5: Neural translation model part 2, due November 8

Late penalty for homework assignments: 10% per day.
